title: Cross seam
---

The **cross seam** is measured from the waist line at the front to the waist line the back, passing under your crotch.

The measuring tape must capture the fullness of your buttocks instead of taking a shortcut through the intergluteal cleft (the butt crack), especially if you have a large [seat](/docs/measurements/seat/) and find that your bottom garments don't have enough rise in the rear. There are multiple ways to do this:

- Place a large piece of flexible cardstock (e.g. a pamphlet or a piece of junk mail) over the visible part of the the cleft. You can hold it in place with a little tension in the measuring tape.
- Take the measurement while wearing structured pants or shorts. Underwear on its own is too pliable.

Also tie a string around your waist to mark the endpoints for the measuring tape.

Once you're ready, measure your **cross seam** by running your measuring tape down from the
center front of your waist, between your legs, and up the center back until you meet the string
at your waist.
